# Getting started

So you're interested in PascalCoin? There are few things you should know before you get started.

## Wallets vs. Accounts

Like most cryptocurrencies, PascalCoin has a wallet which stores a series of cryptographic Key-Pairs. Key-pairs are comprised of a Private Key and a Public Key. The most important thing you need to know is that you need to protect your Private Key. Don't lose it! Without it, you can't access your Pascals. Don't share it! If someone else gets hold of your Private Key, they have access to your coins!

Unlike most cryptocurrencies, Pascal (PASC) isn't stored directly against your Public Key. Instead, Pascals and transactions are stored against a PascalCoin account (PASA), and accounts are stored against your Public Key.

You may give other people your Public Key, but usually only to transfer or assign a PASA. If someone wants to send you PASC, you only need to give them the PASA number you want Pascals sent to.

Now that you understand the basics, it's time to setup your wallet and get your first Pascals!

## Get your first PASA

Your wallet is ready to go but you need your first PascalCoin account (PASA). There are many ways to obtain your first PASA. Please note since the commoditization of PASAs is essential for PascalCoin's ingenious infrastructure, one may need to purchase a PASA at an inexpensive price and/or obtain a free PASA through nontraditional means.

**Purchase a PASA via a website service**

 You can easily purchase a PASA for an inexpensive price from:
* [GetPasa.com](https://getpasa.com) - a simple way to get your first PASA
* [PascWallet.com](https://pascwallet.com) - a PASA exchange for buying and selling PASA 

**Obtain a free PASA via the Discord donation bot**

The PascalCoin community at Discord has built a PASA donation bot as part of its faucet. Check it out to see if you can get a PASA for free!

* [PASA Faucet](https://www.pascalcoin.org/content/wallet_pascal_pasa_faucet) 

**Obtain a free PASA via a tweet**

Coming soon.

**Obtain a free PASA via a SMS verification**

Visit freepasa.org and get a PASA for free using your phone number.

* [freepasa.org](https://freepasa.org) 

**Otain unlimited pseudo-PASAs with ease**

Coming soon. A Layer-2 application for PascalCoin as part of V5 is in the works that would enable unlimited pseudo-PASA accounts via a PASA staker set - similar to a proof-of-stake paradigm - and therefore removing the need to directly own a PASA as an additional option.

**Obtain a free PASA by simply activating your Android/iOS wallet**

Coming soon with the upcoming wallet releases for Android and iOS. Free PASA acquisition would be possible since mobile devices have unique identifiers, such as SIMs, compared to general computers. This makes mobile wallets naturally resistant to PASA abuse.

**Obtain a PASA via mining**

Mining yields not only PASC but also PASA. Each block yields 50 PASC and 5 PASA.

"This is starting to feel a bit too hard." - no problem! We have an enthusiastic and friendly community of people available to help, many of which have donated PASAs for first time users. Come join our Discord chat.

## Get some PASC

Now that you have your own PASA, it's time to put some PASC in it!

**Purchasing PASC**

There are a number of exchanges available to purchase PASC with more being added in the future. Many don't allow you to purchase with regular currency, so you may need purchase alternate coins like Bitcoin or Ethereum first and then exchange them for PASC.

Once you have purchased PASC on an exchange, it's just a matter of transferring it to your new PASA. Remember you only have to use your PASA number(s) for transfers, not your Public Key. It's that simple!

The following exchanges are available for purchasing PASC:
* [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/exchange#btc_pasc) 
* [FinexBox](https://www.finexbox.com/)
* [BKEX](bkex.com)
* [Tokok](https://www.tokok.com/index)
* [QBTC](https://www.myqbtc.com) 
* [CryptoMonster](https://www.cryptomonster.co.uk/buy-pascal-coin) - purchase using bank-wires
* [Bitsquare](https://bisq.network/) - decentralised and anonymous but low volume
* [Frizen](http://exchange.frizen.eu/) - PASC/BCC exchange - a community project
* [SimpleSwap](https://simpleswap.io) -  selects the best available exchange rate

**Mining PASC**

If you have hardware, especially one that is CPU-based, you may wish to mine PASC.
