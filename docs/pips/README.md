# Pascal Improvement Proposals

A PascalCoin Improvement Proposal (PIP) is a design document for introducing features and/or information into PascalCoin. As of this publication date, this is the standard way for changes to be introduced into PascalCoin. Anyone can submit a PIP and all PIPs are evaluated through the PIP Workflow.

PIPs are intended to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features and documenting design decisions. It is the responsibility of the PIP author to document community consensus including dissenting opinions.
